                <p class="card-text">A crucial part of the process was interviewing prospective users. I chose people across different backgrounds who were intrigued and interested by travel. I wanted individuals with something to say, and who were curious and experimental.

                <h4>How might we inspire users like Cyprian to get them excited about their next trip?</h4>
                <p class="card-text">During qualitative research, we discovered that people who described themselves as outgoing and/or adventurous were more likely to respond positively to the prospect of taking a spur of the moment trip to a completely random destination, if factors such as money and time were otherwise accounted for. <br><br>

                  Therefore, we believe that a market for personalized-yet-randomized travel itineraries and inspiration exists and that we might be able to help if we [create an app that synthesizes peoples’ need for unique travel inspiration with the ability to generate and book itineraries/experiences that speak to the user’s desire for novelty and excitement].
                  <br><br>
                  We might do this by [creating a “put your finger on the globe” feature, which enables the user to generate a full itinerary based on pure chance. For users who are more reluctant to book vacations based on complete chance, we can set parameters that stick to a particular region, area, or take more personal preferences into account ]. Doing this will allow our product to [become the premiere destination for people who are looking to book travel, and a hub for people who are  looking for compelling travel inspiration].</p>

Through my research, I learned that there wasn't really a place that combined travel inspiration with the ability to generate customized itinerary.
